                        We all like to play volleyball and have a good time, but
                        if you stop to think about it, that usually only happens
                        on teams that are well run. Being a team captain in this
                        league is about fielding a competitive team and then
                        motivating, inspiring and leading your team to the big
                        victory! Towards that end, here is a summary of what
                        future team captains should expect.

                        Before we get into expectations, there are some key
                        principles that all players (captains included) should
                        try to remember:

                    <ul className="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-muted-foreground">

                            <strong>fun</strong>.

                        <li>
                            Fun means being treated equally and feeling like you
                            are a welcome contributor to your team – being
                            appreciated for the skills and effort you bring and
                            getting to play at an appropriate level, ideally on
                            a competitive team.

                            Players who are not having fun will eventually stop
                            playing in BSD, so it is fundamental that we as a
                            league and you as a team captain work to provide
                            everyone a fun experience.

                            The BSD League generally prefers captains who have
                            played at least the previous season in the same
                            division. Sometimes this rule is waived if the
                            league is having difficulty fielding enough captains
                            for a division.

                            You don&apos;t need to be the most experienced or
                            best player to be a successful captain. You can draw
                            upon commissioners and other captains for help
                            during the draft and you can draw upon your
                            teammates for their input on lineups and strategy.
                            It can take a while for a new captain to feel
                            completely comfortable handling all aspects of the
                            position on his/her own.

                        The best way to field a competitive team is to draft a
                        good combination of skills, athleticism and
                        personalities. How do you do that?

                            captain, ask for information on how the player draft
                            is handled.

                            Please keep in mind – we all like to play with our
                            friends, but it&apos;s seldom fun to play on a team
                            full of friends who aren&apos;t competitive. Your
                            objective is to draft a competitive team. Think
                            about it. If you draft a team comprised primarily of
                            your friends, and the team is not competitive, your
                            friends will not have a fun experience and they may
                            not appreciate your efforts!

                        <li>
                            One goal we recommend going into the team draft is
                            to have a ranked list of men and a ranked list of
                            women. That way, when it reaches your turn in the
                            draft, you can take the highest ranked man/woman
                            still available – with some adjustments for skills
                            or personalities to fit in with others on your team.

                                    details. The more you know, the better you
                                    can gauge where players rank relative to one
                                    another.

                                    attention to the next-lower division! If you
                                    want to be a winning captain, recognize that
                                    sometimes players (especially newer players)
                                    get placed too low and it&apos;ll help the
                                    league as a whole (and your team in
                                    particular) if you spot that talent for the
                                    next season&apos;s draft.

                                    <strong>And of course–</strong> go to the
                                    tryouts! We hold these solely for captains
                                    to see players demonstrate their skills and
                                    team-playing abilities. And don&apos;t just
                                    focus on newer, unknown players – even
                                    seasoned players change. Sometimes they take
                                    clinics or start playing more often and it
                                    will reflect in their skills. Tryouts can be
                                    chaotic, you will find it challenging to
                                    mentally keep track of players &amp; your
                                    evaluations of them, so be prepared to take

                                    Keep track of your player&apos;s schedules -
                                    ask them to notify you as soon as they know
                                    they will be missing a match. If your team
                                    will have fewer than 6 players planning to
                                    show up for a match, work ahead of time to
                                    arrange for a sub. Follow the league&apos;s
                                    rules regarding substitute players and make
                                    sure you coordinate your sub with the
                                    opposing team&apos;s captain before the
                                    match starts. Remember, the opposing captain
                                    has a right to not approve a sub who&apos;s
                                    skill level is too far above the player
                                    he/she is replacing. Don&apos;t look for a
                                    competitive advantage when arranging for a
                                    sub. Your goal in this situation is to field
                                    a team and avoid a forfeit - your players
                                    should be happy to be playing regardless.

                                    Think ahead to come up with lineups for the
                                    players who will be there.

                                    Make sure your lineups allow players a fair
                                    opportunity to contribute to the team – do
                                    not plan lineups that isolate a person to no
                                    effective play. Why do we say this? Because
                                    there have been complaints about exactly
                                    this type of thing in the past, and you
                                    would <em>think</em> it wouldn&apos;t need
                                    to be said explicitly, but yet it still
                                    seems to occur every so often. Every person
                                    pays the same amount of money and deserves a
                                    fair share of the plays. Please keep this in
                                    mind.

                                    In our co-ed league, women in the front row
                                    often play as setters in a 4-2 format (4
                                    potential hitters &amp; 2 setters on the
                                    court at any time). This is not a rule by
                                    any measure, but the men&apos;s height nets
                                    make hitting a challenge for players whose
                                    hands don&apos;t clear the plane of the net
                                    on a jump. There have been many exceptional
                                    women&apos;s hitters in our league, so
                                    design your lineups to your individual
                                    players&apos; strengths.

                                    We do not recommend teams playing a 6-2
                                    format or 5-1 format unless equal
                                    opportunities are given to the women in the
                                    front row for hitting. Why do we say this?
                                    Because some teams in the past have played
                                    these formats and bias the sets to the male
                                    hitters on the front row, leaving the
                                    front-row women with very little chance to
                                    play and contribute. You would{" "}

                                    Good captains will take the time to not only
                                    lead with their play on the court but to
                                    also observe their team to get a sense of
                                    their player&apos;s strengths and
                                    weaknesses. This will help you adjust your
                                    lineups to balance players – i.e., put
                                    quicker players around someone who seems to
                                    move slow, or put good passers around
                                    someone who is struggling to pass well that
                                    night.

                                    captain can talk to the referee – other
                                    players should never initiate a discussion
                                    with the ref about calls, etc. Make sure you
                                    tell your teammates to funnel all such
                                    questions through the floor/team captain.
